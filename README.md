# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 - Javascript and APIs

The purpose of project was to use Leaflet and Javascript to generate interactive multilayer maps from JSON formatted data. GeoJSON earthquake data was called using 
D3 and Mapbox API and tectonic plate GeoJSON data was accessed from a public GitHub repository. Three different map styles can be selected along with filters to display 
all earthquake location and magnitude data indicated by circle markers, tectonic plate lines, as well specifically as 4.5+ magnitude earthquake locations. These customized maps are built into an HTML webpage for easy access.
